# My Clerks

A simple slider component made with HTML, Javascript, CSS.

## Installation

To run it locally:

  npm run dev
```

To run tests:

```
  npm run test
```

## Notes

- This mini project was created with vanilla javascript, because I wanted to challenge myself and dive more into Javascript.
- Many challenges occured, the main one was whether to store api data in a storage/state or not. I chose not to use a storage for this implementation. In a real world scenario I would treat this a little differently to achieve better perfomance and less dom manipulation.
- The persistance of the theming was implemented with localStorage, so I can have the selected color if the page reloads.

## Next steps

- I believe I have a logic error when I make a call to fetch more data. I cannot overcome this and I would ask help from the team.
- I would add touch controls and keyboard navigation.
